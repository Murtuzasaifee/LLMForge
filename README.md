LLMForge is a hands-on project focused on building Large Language Models (LLMs) entirely from scratch. Whether youâ€™re a machine learning enthusiast, a researcher, or an engineer curious about the inner workings of modern LLMs, this project demystifies the black box by reconstructing core components step by step â€” with zero reliance on high-level frameworks.
